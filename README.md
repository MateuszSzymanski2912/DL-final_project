# DL-final_project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook developed as a final project for the Introduction to Deep Learning course at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.

The main objective of the project is to predict coronary heart disease (CHD) using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The notebook explores both basic models—such as logistic regression—and more advanced architectures, including autoencoders.
